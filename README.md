This project is all about Interprocess Communication.In computer science, inter-process communication or interprocess communication (IPC) refers specifically to the mechanisms an operating system provides to allow the processes to manage shared data.
Pipes are used for communication between processes. The named pipes are fifos. They enable two way communication unlike ordinary pipes. But they are half duplex, i.e. communication can take place only in one direction at a time.
